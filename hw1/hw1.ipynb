    "> In this homework, we will use US Housing dataset. You will develop linear regression with gradient decent algorithm to estimate the price of the house. In this homework, we will use 70% and 30% split between training and evaluation (test) sets across all problems. (Note: You cannot use the built-in function from ML libraries for gradient descent, you must implement it yourself. However, you can use built-in function for normalization/standardization)\n",
